# About:
Pubg Mobile Color based aimbot. Works on any android emulator. Fully undetected as it doesnt change any memory or game files. It works only on image recognation. Made specially for tdm mode.

# How It Works:
- It makes screenshots as your refresh rate every second
- Checks if on the screen is any red pixels(player outline) via hsv pattern
- If any, calculate the highest pixel(head) of them and move mouse to the pixel.

# Showcase (Tampered settings):
